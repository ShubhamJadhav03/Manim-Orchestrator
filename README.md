## 🌟 Overview

**Manim AI** is a **full-stack web application** that generates stunning 2D animations directly from text prompts.  
It uses an **AI model (CodeLlama)** to produce Python code for the [Manim Engine](https://www.manim.community/) — bringing ideas to life as animated scenes.

The project includes a **3-panel scene editor** that allows users to preview, rearrange, and export multi-scene videos — all in a browser.

## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| 🤖 **AI-Generated Animations** | Converts text prompts into executable Manim scripts using **CodeLlama** via **Ollama**. |
| 🎬 **3-Panel Scene Editor** | Built with React + Tailwind — includes Scene Bin, Drag-and-Drop Timeline, and Live Preview. |
| 🎞️ **Smart Video Stitching** | Combines multiple scenes into one polished `.mp4` file using **FFmpeg**. |
| ⚙️ **Scalable Backend** | Asynchronous FastAPI server with **Celery** workers for non-blocking video jobs. |
| 🐳 **One-Command Setup** | Entire stack runs in **Docker** — Frontend, Backend, Worker, Redis, PostgreSQL. |
| ✅ **CI/CD Ready** | Includes **GitHub Actions** + **Pytest** for automated backend testing. |

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

The application follows a **modern, microservices-oriented design**, ensuring scalability and fault isolation.

### 🧠 Workflow Summary
1. The **React frontend** sends the user’s prompt to the **FastAPI backend**.  
2. FastAPI logs the task in **PostgreSQL** and enqueues it in **Redis**.  
3. A **Celery worker** pulls the job, calls **Ollama → CodeLlama**, and runs **Manim** to render the animation.  
4. The worker updates the database with progress and file paths.  
5. The frontend polls for updates and previews the generated scene when ready.

## ⚡ Getting Started (Local Setup)

The app is **fully containerized**, so you can spin it up with one command.

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed & running  
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and the model pulled:

  ```bash
  ollama pull codellama:7b
  ```

---

### 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamJadhav03/Cursor-For--2D-Videos.git
   cd Cursor-For--2D-Videos
   ```

2. **Build & start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   > This command launches the Frontend, Backend, Worker, Redis, and PostgreSQL services simultaneously.

3. **Access the app**
   - 🌐 Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
   - ⚙️ API Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
